    ": T-test and Z-test are both statistical hypothesis tests used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data, but they are typically used under different circumstances due to differences in assumptions. Here's a summary of the key differences and an example scenario for each test:\n",
    "\n",
    "T-Test:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption: The t-test assumes that the population follows a normal distribution, and it is best used when the sample size is small (typically less than 30) or when the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "Example Scenario: Suppose you want to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean exam scores between two different classes (Class A and Class B) in a small school. You have sample data from each class (e.g., 15 students in each class), and you do not know the population standard deviation. In this case, you would use a two-sample t-test.\n",
    "Z-Test:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption: The z-test assumes that the population follows a normal distribution, and it is appropriate when the sample size is large (typically greater than 30) or when the population standard deviation is known.\n",
    "Example Scenario: Let's say you are a quality control manager at a factory, and you want to test if a new manufacturing process has significantly improved the mean weight of a product. You have a large sample size (e.g., 1000 products) from the new process, and you also know the population standard deviation based on historical data. In this case, you would use a z-test."
