    "Effects on Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: Outliers can have a substantial influence on the mean (average) of a dataset. Since the mean is calculated by summing up all the values and dividing by the number of values, even a single outlier with an extremely high or low value can pull the mean in its direction. For example, if you have a dataset [10, 15, 20, 25, 100], the outlier 100 will significantly increase the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is less affected by outliers compared to the mean. An outlier would only impact the median if it falls in the middle of the ordered dataset. For example, in the dataset [10, 15, 20, 25, 100], the median would be unaffected by the outlier 100, as it still falls between the 20 and 25 values.\n",

    "Range: Outliers can significantly affect the range, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. If an outlier is much larger or smaller than the rest of the data, it can cause the range to increase or decrease substantially.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance and Standard Deviation: Outliers can substantially impact the variance and standard deviation. Since these measures take into account the squared deviations of data points from the mean, outliers can contribute disproportionately large values to these calculations."
