    "GridSearchCV (Grid Search Cross-Validation) is a technique used in machine learning to systematically search for the optimal hyperparameters for a given model. Hyperparameters are the configuration settings of a model that are not learned from the data but are set prior to the training process. Examples include the learning rate in a neural network or the depth of a decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of GridSearchCV is to automate the process of tuning hyperparameters by evaluating a model's performance across a predefined grid of hyperparameter values. This helps to find the combination of hyperparameters that yields the best performance according to a specified evaluation metric, such as accuracy or F1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how GridSearchCV works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define Hyperparameter Grid: You specify a set of hyperparameters and their possible values that you want to search over. For example, you might want to explore different values for the learning rate, regularization strength, or the number of layers in a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Validation: GridSearchCV uses a cross-validation approach to assess the model's performance for each combination of hyperparameters. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets (folds), training the model on some folds, and evaluating it on others. This helps to ensure a more robust evaluation of the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Training: For each combination of hyperparameters, the model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the validation set using cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance Metric: The performance of the model for each set of hyperparameters is determined based on the chosen evaluation metric (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall). This metric is typically specified by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Select Best Hyperparameters: After evaluating the model's performance for all combinations, GridSearchCV selects the hyperparameters that result in the best performance according to the specified metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Model: The final model is then trained using the selected optimal hyperparameters on the entire training dataset"

    "Data leakage refers to the unintentional inclusion of information in the training data that allows a machine learning model to make unrealistically good predictions on new, unseen data. In other words, the model has access to information during training that it would not have when making predictions in a real-world scenario. Data leakage can lead to overly optimistic performance estimates and the development of models that do not generalize well to new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data leakage can occur in various forms, and it's crucial to detect and prevent it to ensure the model's reliability and generalization ability. There are two main types of data leakage: target leakage and temporal leakage.\n",

    "Target Leakage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Target leakage occurs when information that would not be available at the time of prediction is included in the training data.\n",
    "Example: Suppose you are building a model to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent. If you include the transaction amount as a feature in your model, and this amount is known at the time of the transaction, it would lead to target leakage. In a real-world scenario, the model wouldn't have access to the transaction amount at the time of prediction. Including this information in the training data could result in a model that falsely learns to associate certain transaction amounts with fraud, leading to poor generalization.\n",
    "Temporal Leakage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Temporal leakage occurs when information from the future is used to predict past events, simulating a scenario where the model has access to information that it wouldn't have in a real-time prediction scenario.\n",
    "Example: Suppose you are predicting stock prices, and your dataset includes information about future events (e.g., stock prices from the next day). If you use this information to train your model, it would lead to temporal leakage. In reality, the model should only have access to historical data up to the point of prediction. Including future information can result in an overly optimistic evaluation of the model's performance, as it has effectively \"cheated\" by using data from the future during training."
