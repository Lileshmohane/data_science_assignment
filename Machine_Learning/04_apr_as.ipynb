    "A decision tree classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by recursively partitioning the dataset into subsets based on the values of different features, ultimately leading to a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a decision based on a specific feature, and each leaf node represents the predicted class or value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the decision tree classifier algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Root Node: The algorithm starts with the entire dataset as the root node. It selects the feature that best splits the data into subsets, considering criteria like Gini impurity, information gain, or gain ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting: The selected feature is used to split the dataset into subsets. Each subset corresponds to a unique value of the chosen feature. This process is repeated for each subset, creating child nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Child Nodes: For each child node, the algorithm repeats the splitting process by selecting the best feature from the remaining features. This process continues recursively until a stopping criterion is met. Stopping criteria may include a maximum depth for the tree, a minimum number of samples in a node, or a minimum improvement in impurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaf Nodes: When a stopping criterion is reached, a leaf node is created, and it is assigned the class label that is most prevalent in the corresponding subset of data. For regression tasks, the leaf node may contain the mean or median value of the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictions: To make predictions for a new instance, the algorithm traverses the decision tree from the root node down to a leaf node based on the feature values of the instance. The predicted class or value associated with the leaf node is then assigned as the final prediction."
