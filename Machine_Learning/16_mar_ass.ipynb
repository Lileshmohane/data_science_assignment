    "L2 Regularization (Ridge):\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works: L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the model's parameters. It discourages the parameters from becoming too large, helping to smooth the model's predictions.\n",
    "Use cases: L2 regularization is effective when all features are potentially relevant, but you want to prevent the model from assigning very high weights to any specific feature.\n",
    "Elastic Net Regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works: Elastic Net regularization combines L1 and L2 regularization by adding both penalties to the loss function. It balances feature selection (L1) and feature coefficient shrinkage (L2).\n",
    "Use cases: Elastic Net is a good choice when you want a compromise between L1 and L2 regularization and have both relevant features to select and potentially correlated features.\n",
    "Dropout (for Neural Networks):\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works: Dropout is a technique applied during training in neural networks. It randomly deactivates a subset of neurons (nodes) in each forward and backward pass. This prevents the network from relying too heavily on any specific neuron, making it more robust and reducing overfitting.\n",
    "Use cases: Dropout is commonly used in deep learning, especially in convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks.\n",
    "Early Stopping:\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works: During training, monitor the model's performance on a validation dataset. Stop training when the performance on the validation set starts to degrade or stagnate. This prevents the model from continuing to fit the training data and overfitting.\n",
    "Use cases: Early stopping is particularly useful in iterative learning algorithms like gradient descent.\n",
    "Batch Normalization:\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works: Batch normalization is applied to neural networks and helps stabilize and regularize training by normalizing the inputs to each layer within a mini-batch. It can reduce internal covariate shift and improve convergence.\n",
