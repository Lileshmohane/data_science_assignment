    "Ridge Regression, also known as Tikhonov regularization or L2 regularization, is a linear regression technique used for dealing with multicollinearity in the data. In ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, the goal is to minimize the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values. However, when there is multicollinearity (high correlation) among the independent variables, OLS estimates can become unstable, leading to inflated standard errors and less reliable predictions."

    "Ridge Regression shares many assumptions with ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, as it is essentially a modification of OLS to address certain issues like multicollinearity. The main assumptions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is assumed to be linear. Ridge Regression, like OLS, is a linear regression technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence of Errors: The errors (residuals) in the model should be independent of each other. This assumption is crucial for obtaining unbiased and efficient estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors should be constant across all levels of the independent variables. In other words, the spread of residuals should be roughly the same for all values of the predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality of Errors: While OLS assumes normality of errors for statistical inference (e.g., hypothesis testing and confidence intervals), Ridge Regression is often used in situations where this assumption is relaxed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity: Ridge Regression is specifically designed to handle multicollinearity, a situation where independent variables are highly correlated. The assumption here is that multicollinearity is present, and Ridge Regression is employed to mitigate its effects on the OLS estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Perfect Collinearity: Perfect collinearity, where one independent variable is a perfect linear function of another, can cause issues in regression models. Ridge Regression helps mitigate this problem by stabilizing the estimates in the presence of multicollinearity.\n"
