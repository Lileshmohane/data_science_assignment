    "Linear regression makes several assumptions about the data to ensure the validity of the model. It's essential to check these assumptions before relying on the results of a linear regression analysis. Here are the key assumptions:\n",

    "Linearity: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is assumed to be linear. You can check this assumption by plotting the data and examining whether a straight line adequately represents the relationship.\n",

    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals should be constant across all levels of the independent variables. This means that the spread of residuals should be roughly the same throughout the range of predicted values. A plot of residuals against fitted values can help in checking for homoscedasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality of Residuals: The residuals should follow a normal distribution. You can check this assumption using a histogram or a Q-Q plot of the residuals.\n",

High correlation between independent variables can cause issues in estimating the coefficients. You can check for multicollinearity using variance inflation factor (VIF) values.\n",
