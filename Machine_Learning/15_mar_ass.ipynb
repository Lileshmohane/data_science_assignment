    "a) Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems or machines that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions. AI can be classified into two categories: narrow or weak AI, which is designed for specific tasks, and general or strong AI, which can perform any intellectual task that a human can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "One common example of AI is a virtual personal assistant like Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, or Google Assistant. These AI-driven systems can understand voice commands, answer questions, set alarms, and perform tasks like sending messages or making calls.\n",

    "b) Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, a machine learning model learns patterns and makes predictions or decisions based on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose you want to build a spam email filter. In traditional programming, you might write specific rules to identify spam emails. In contrast, with machine learning, you would feed the model a dataset of labeled emails (spam or not spam) and let it learn from these examples. The model would then use this knowledge to classify new emails as spam or not.\n",

    "In machine learning, the process of splitting a dataset into three parts: training set, validation set, and test set is a common practice to evaluate and fine-tune models effectively. Each of these sets plays a specific role in the model development and evaluation process, and their importance can be explained as follows:\n",

A well-trained model should be able to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data based on what it has learned from the training set.\n",
    "Validation Set:\n",

    "Role: The validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and assess the model's performance during training. It helps in selecting the best model out of different variations or hyperparameter settings.\n",
    "Importance: By evaluating the model on the validation set, you can fine-tune its hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, regularization strength) and detect issues such as overfitting or underfitting. The validation set provides an unbiased estimate of the model's performance and helps you make informed decisions about model improvements.\n",
    "Test Set:\n",

    "Training Set: The training set is essential for building a model that learns from the data, and its quality directly impacts the model's ability to make accurate predictions.\n",
    "Validation Set: The validation set is crucial for optimizing the model's hyperparameters and ensuring that it generalizes well to new data. It helps avoid overfitting and underfitting.\n",
