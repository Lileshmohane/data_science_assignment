    "An API acts as a bridge between different applications, allowing them to communicate and share data with each other. APIs can provide developers with access to features and functionality of an existing application or service, without requiring them to understand the underlying code or infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "One example of an API in real life is the Google Maps API, which allows developers to integrate Google Maps into their own applications. This means that users can view and interact with maps and location data without leaving the developer's application. The Google Maps API provides developers with access to features such as searching for locations, getting directions, and displaying custom markers, overlays, and other information on the map. This is particularly useful for applications that rely on location data, such as ride-sharing or delivery services"
