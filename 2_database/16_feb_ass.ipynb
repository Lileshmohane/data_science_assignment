    "A database is a collection of data that is organized in a structured way to allow efficient retrieval, storage, and management of data. Databases can be used to store a variety of data, such as customer information, financial transactions, inventory, and more. They are used in various industries and applications, including e-commerce, healthcare, finance, and education.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two main types of databases, and they differ in how they store and retrieve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that use tables to store data. They follow a strict schema, meaning that the structure of the data must be defined before it can be stored. SQL databases use a standardized language, SQL, to manipulate and retrieve data. SQL databases are known for their ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance, which ensures data consistency and reliability. Popular examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that store data in a flexible, non-tabular format. They can store unstructured and semi-structured data, such as JSON documents or key-value pairs. NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of data, and they are highly scalable and can handle rapid changes to data structure. NoSQL databases are often used in big data and real-time web applications. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Couchbase."
