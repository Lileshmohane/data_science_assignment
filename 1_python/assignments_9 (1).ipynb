    "ANS = Abstraction is one of the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) and it refers to the process of hiding the implementation details of a class and only showing the necessary information to the user. It helps in reducing the complexity of a system and improving the readability of code by only exposing the necessary details to the user.\n",

    "For example, consider a car. As a user, you only need to know how to start the car, accelerate it, turn it left or right, and stop it. You don't need to know the details of how the engine works or how the transmission system functions. This is an example of abstraction. The car class can hide the implementation details of the engine and the transmission system, and only expose the necessary details to the user, such as the start, accelerate, turn, and stop methods.\n",

    "ANS = Abstraction refers to the process of hiding the implementation details of a class and only exposing the necessary information to the user.

    "Encapsulation refers to the process of wrapping up the data and the functions that operate on that data within an object. It is the mechanism of binding the data and the functions that operate on that data together as a single unit, or object. Encapsulation provides a way to protect the data from unauthorized access and modification by restricting access to the object's internals.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a bank account. The bank account is an object that encapsulates the account balance and the functions that operate on that balance, such as deposit and withdrawal. The abstraction of the bank account class is to provide a simple interface to the user to deposit and withdraw funds, while hiding the implementation details of how the balance is maintained and updated. The user only needs to know the deposit and withdrawal methods, but not the internal details of how the balance is updated.\n",
