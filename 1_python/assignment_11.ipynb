    "In Python, the close() function is used to close a file that has been opened with the open() function. It is important to close a file after reading from or writing to it, because it releases the system resources (e.g., file descriptor) associated with the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a file is not closed properly, it can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. For example, if you try to open a file that is already open, you may get a \"File in use\" error. In addition, not closing a file can lead to data loss or corruption, particularly if you are writing to the file.\n",

    "Closing a file is also important for performance reasons. If you keep a file open for a long time, it can tie up system resources and slow down your program. By closing a file as soon as you are done with it, you free up those resources for other parts of your program or other programs running on the system.\n"
